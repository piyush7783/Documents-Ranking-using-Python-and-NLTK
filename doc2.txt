A document is relevant if it addresses the stated information need, not because it just happens
to contain all the words in the query. This distinction is often misunderstood in practice, because
the information needed is not overt. But, nevertheless, an information need is present. If a user
types python into a web search engine, they might be wanting to know where they can purchase
a pet python.
