The Indian entertainment industry is estimated to have lost at least 1,000 crore rupees
($133 million) since the virus lockdown was imposed in March. Producers said the
precautions were necessary to resume work, especially for those who had no other means
to a livelihood or had been rendered jobless by the pandemic.
